# 🌍 World Image Application — Modern Computer Vision with PyTorch

This repository contains my study notes and code implementations from the **"World Image Application"** chapter in the book _Modern Computer Vision with PyTorch_ by V Kishore Ayyadevara and Yeshwanth Reddy. The focus is on building real-world applications using PyTorch and computer vision concepts.

## 📖 About the Book Section

The "World Image Application" chapter walks through the process of creating a real-world CV application using PyTorch. It covers essential topics like:
- Image classification and feature extraction
- Transfer learning with pretrained models
- Building and deploying image-based solutions
- Evaluation and optimization of models

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- ✅ **Transfer Learning**: Efficient reuse of pretrained models like ResNet and EfficientNet for classification tasks.
- ✅ **Feature Extraction**: Extracting meaningful information from image tensors to feed into fully connected layers.
- ✅ **Custom Dataset and DataLoader**: Using `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` and creating robust `transform` pipelines.
- ✅ **Model Training Loop**: Understanding the training-validation flow and implementing epoch-level tracking.
- ✅ **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and class-wise performance analysis.
- ✅ **Saving and Loading Models**: Best practices with `torch.save()` and `torch.load()`.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook
